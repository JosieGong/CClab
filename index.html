                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Josie, March, 2024, after getting a 64 in the midterm</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Sentiflora belongs to the Spiriacie family. People define this family as consisting of creatures that can connect with people's spirits or feelings. However, so far, Sentiflora is the only creature found in this family. Research is ongoing, and there seems to be some evidence suggesting that a creature which connects with people's memories also exists, though scientists havenâ€™t found enough evidence yet...  </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Sentifloras live in a virtual environment called the Mind Garden, which can normally only be seen after proper hypnosis treatment. However, there are some chances that you could fall into the garden without any hypnosis, usually when you constantly feel strong emotions or suddenly 'realize something'. This is how the scientist discovered the Mind Garden and Sentiflora. The Mind Garden is an area that looks like a pond. The 'water' is pure and stably connected with our minds, and only in this environment can the Sentiflora grow and not be influenced by anything but people's moods.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Sentiflora consists of several ellipses by default but can unfurl more layers of geometric patterns after being fed. It looks like a flower, in a 2-dimensional world, however. Each Sentiflora's color is different, but they are all in light colors. After being influenced by different moods, their colors also change. </p>

                The Sentiflora is a creature that partially reflects people's spirit and is connected to our mental world. It either grows or becomes smaller depending on the influence of moods. It also sways in various ways and changes colors in response to different emotions.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Grow some Sentifloras. Please care for them, as well as yourselves. When you feel certain moods, click the feed button to use your moods to feed them. Normally, they grow when they sense your feed. However, if your mood is too strong, they might stop growing, and if you are in a low mood constantly for a long time, they may be hurt and become smaller!
