                <p>Josie, March, 2024, after getting a 64 in midterm</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Sentiflora belongs to the Spiriacie family. People define this family as consisting of creatures that can connect with people's spirits or feelings. However, so far, Sentiflora is the only creature found in this family. Research is ongoing, and there seems to be some evidence suggesting that a creature which connects with people's memories also exists, though scientists havenâ€™t found enough evidence yet...  </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Sentifloras live in a virtual environment called the Mind Garden, which can normally only be seen after proper hypnosis treatment. However, there are some chances that you could fall into the garden without any hypnosis, usually when you constantly feel strong emotions or suddenly 'realize something'. This is how scientists discovered the Mind Garden and Sentiflora. The Mind Garden is an area that looks like a pond. The 'water' is pure and stably connected with our minds, and only in this environment can the Sentiflora grow and not be influenced by anything but people's moods.</p>

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as
                well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
                record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your
                creature.)
